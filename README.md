# Fire-Detection-System
At a time when forest fires continue to rage on unabated, it has become possible to manage them by utilizing the technological tools at our disposal. If we can detect a fire in its early stages through photographs or videos, we can prevent it from growing and spreading. We will also develop a fire detection system using image processing techniques in this project.
